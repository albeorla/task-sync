Here's the proposed workflow management system tailored to the context:

1. **Project Hierarchy Structure:**
   - Main Project: API Connectors Development
     - Sub-projects: Google Calendar Connector, Todoist Connector, Notion Connector

2. **Task Allocation:**
   Each sub-project will have the following tasks:
   - Understanding the respective API
   - Handling authentication
   - Developing the connector
   - Implementing robust error handling
   - Managing data synchronization
   - Testing the connector
   - Deploying the connector
   - Monitoring the connector
   - Maintaining the connector

3. **Overlap and Redundancy Resolution:**
   To avoid overlaps and redundancies, a clear task management system will be implemented. Each developer will be assigned specific tasks. For task dependencies, the dependent task will not start until the prerequisite task is completed.

4. **Task Management Platform:**
   The whole process will take place on a task management platform. This platform will provide a clear vision of the project progression, task dependencies, and individual responsibilities.

5. **Progress Reporting and Communication:**
   Regular meetings will be held to discuss the project's progress. This will ensure everyone is aware of the development, blockers, and next steps.

6. **Documentation:**
   A proper documentation process will be followed. Every step of the development will be documented and shared with the team. This will ensure that everyone has access to the latest updates and can help resolve issues faster.

7. **Feedback and Improvement:**
   A feedback loop will be implemented for continuous improvement. Every phase of the project will be analyzed for potential improvements in the workflow.
